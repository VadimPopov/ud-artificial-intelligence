## Project Overview

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

![ASR Pipeline][image1]

We begin by investigating the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12/) that will be used to train and evaluate your models. Your algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. You will then move on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, you will engage in your own investigations by creating and testing your own state-of-the-art models. Throughout the notebook, we provide recommended research papers for additional reading and links to GitHub repositories with interesting implementations.

## Project Instructions

### Local Environment Setup

You should run this project with GPU acceleration for best performance.

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/AIND-VUI-Capstone.git
cd AIND-VUI-Capstone
```

2. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6 and the `numpy` package.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__:
	```
	conda create --name aind-vui python=3.5 numpy
	source activate aind-vui
	```
	- __Windows__:
	```
	conda create --name aind-vui python=3.5 numpy scipy
	activate aind-vui
	```

3. Install TensorFlow.
	- Option 1: __To install TensorFlow with GPU support__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using the Udacity AMI, you can skip this step and only need to install the `tensorflow-gpu` package:
	```
	pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.1.0
	```
	- Option 2: __To install TensorFlow with CPU support only__,
	```
	pip install tensorflow==1.1.0
	```

4. Install a few pip packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__:
	```
	KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
	- __Windows__:
	```
	set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
	python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
	- __NOTE:__ a Keras/Windows bug may give this error after the first epoch of training model 0: `‘rawunicodeescape’ codec can’t decode bytes in position 54-55: truncated \uXXXX `.
To fix it:
		- Find the file `keras/utils/generic_utils.py` that you are using for the capstone project. It should be in your environment under `Lib/site-packages` . This may vary, but if using miniconda, for example, it might be located at `C:/Users/username/Miniconda3/envs/aind-vui/Lib/site-packages/keras/utils`.
		- Copy `generic_utils.py` to `OLDgeneric_utils.py` just in case you need to restore it.
		- Open the `generic_utils.py` file and change this code line:</br>`marshal.dumps(func.code).decode(‘raw_unicode_escape’)`</br>to this code line:</br>`marshal.dumps(func.code).replace(b’\’,b’/’).decode(‘raw_unicode_escape’)`

6. Obtain the `libav` package.
	- __Linux__: `sudo apt-get install libav-tools`
	- __Mac__: `brew install libav`
	- __Windows__: Browse to the [Libav website](https://libav.org/download/)
		- Scroll down to "Windows Nightly and Release Builds" and click on the appropriate link for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
		- Click `nightly-gpl`.
		- Download most recent archive file.
		- Extract the file.  Move the `usr` directory to your C: drive.
		- Go back to your terminal window from above.
	```
	rename C:\usr avconv
    set PATH=C:\avconv\bin;%PATH%
	```

7. Obtain the appropriate subsets of the LibriSpeech dataset, and convert all flac files to wav format.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__:
	```
	wget http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/dev-clean.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf dev-clean.tar.gz
	wget http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/test-clean.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf test-clean.tar.gz
	mv flac_to_wav.sh LibriSpeech
	cd LibriSpeech
	./flac_to_wav.sh
	```
	- __Windows__: Download two files ([file 1](http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/dev-clean.tar.gz) and [file 2](http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/test-clean.tar.gz)) via browser and save in the `AIND-VUI-Capstone` directory.  Extract them with an application that is compatible with `tar` and `gz` such as [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com/). Convert the files from your terminal window.
	```
	move flac_to_wav.sh LibriSpeech
	cd LibriSpeech
	powershell ./flac_to_wav.sh
	```

8. Create JSON files corresponding to the train and validation datasets.
```
cd ..
python create_desc_json.py LibriSpeech/dev-clean/ train_corpus.json
python create_desc_json.py LibriSpeech/test-clean/ valid_corpus.json
```

9. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `aind-vui` environment.  Open the notebook.
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name aind-vui --display-name "aind-vui"
jupyter notebook vui_notebook.ipynb
```

10. Before running code, change the kernel to match the `aind-vui` environment by using the drop-down menu.  Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

## Special Thanks

We have borrowed the `create_desc_json.py` and `flac_to_wav.sh` files from the [ba-dls-deepspeech](https://github.com/baidu-research/ba-dls-deepspeech) repository, along with some functions used to generate spectrograms.
