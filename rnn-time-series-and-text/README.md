## Accelerating the Training Process

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen RNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you have two options:

#### Build your Own Deep Learning Workstation

If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the Keras instructions for [running Keras on GPU](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu).
